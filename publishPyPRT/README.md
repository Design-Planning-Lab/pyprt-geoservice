# PublishPRT  

this subfolder is a POC of setback-per-edge PRT as a geoservice  
when launching through arcgis, `setback.pyt` calls `setbackPerEdge` and prints out a geojson response  
when launching from command line, `caller.py` does calls `setbackPerEdge` with the same arguments


## Status  
currently broken because can't get pyprt working properly in arcgis
